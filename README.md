C Graph Engine — A Fun Little Function Grapher in C
What is this?

Graph_C is a small project I made just for fun — a simple tool that plots mathematical functions using pure C.
No fancy graphics libraries, no frameworks, just plain old C printing shapes that kinda look like graphs.

Why did I make this?

Because it sounded cool.
And because making C draw things is weirdly satisfying.

Features

Plots basic mathematical functions

Adjustable domain, step size, and scaling

ASCII-style graph display

Modular-ish code structure

Surprisingly amusing to play around with

How to Run It

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Aviadalm/graph_proj.git

cd graph_proj

Compile:
gcc graph_main.c general.c parameters.c prass_func.c visuals.c -o main

Run:
./main

If something breaks… well… that’s part of the charm.

Future Ideas (if I ever touch this again)

Add more functions

Make the graph slightly less ugly

Maybe rewrite everything, maybe rewrite nothing, who knows

Feel free to use it however you want.
Just don’t blame me if it does something cursed.
